# yt-dlp Web UI

A not so terrible web ui for yt-dlp.  
Created for the only purpose of *fetching* videos from my server/nas. 

Intended to be used with docker and in standalone mode. üòéüëç

Developed to be as lightweight as possible (because my server is basically an intel atom sbc). 

The bottleneck remains yt-dlp startup time.

**Docker images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui) or [ghcr.io](https://github.com/marcopeocchi/yt-dlp-web-ui/pkgs/container/yt-dlp-web-ui)**.

```sh
docker pull marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
```
```sh
# latest dev
docker pull ghcr.io/marcopeocchi/yt-dlp-web-ui:latest
```

## Changelog
```
05/03/22: Korean translation by kimpig

03/03/22: cut-down image size by switching to Alpine linux based container

01/03/22: Chinese translation by deluxghost

03/02/22: i18n enabled! I need help with the translations :/

27/01/22: Multidownload implemented!

26/01/22: Multiple downloads are being implemented. Maybe by next release they will be there.
Refactoring and JSDoc.

04/01/22: Background jobs now are retrieved!! It's still rudimentary but it leverages on yt-dlp resume feature.

05/05/22: Material UI update.

03/06/22: The most requested feature finally implemented: Format Selection!!

08/06/22: ARM builds.

28/06/22: Reworked resume download feature. Now it's pratically instantaneous. It no longer stops and restarts each process, references to each process are saved in memory.

12/01/23: Switched from TypeScript to Golang on the backend. It was a great effort but it was worth it.
```

## Settings

The currently avaible settings are:
-   Server address
-   Switch theme
-   Extract audio
-   Switch language
-   Optional format selection
-   Override the output filename
-   Override the output path
-   Pass custom yt-dlp arguments safely
-   Download queue (limit concurrent downloads)

## Format selection

This feature is disabled by default as this intended to be used to retrieve the best quality automatically.

To enable it just go to the settings page and enable the **Enable video/audio formats selection** flag!

## Troubleshooting
-   **It says that it isn't connected/ip in the header is not defined.**
    - You must set the server ip address in the settings section (gear icon).
-   **The download  doesn't start.**
    - As before server address is not specified or simply yt-dlp process takes a lot of time to fire up. (Forking yt-dlp isn't fast especially if you have a lower-end/low-power NAS/server/desktop where the server is running)

## [Docker](https://github.com/marcopeocchi/yt-dlp-web-ui/pkgs/container/yt-dlp-web-ui) installation
```sh
docker pull marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
docker run -d -p 3033:3033 -v <your dir>:/downloads marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui
```

Or with docker but building the container manually.

```sh
docker build -t yt-dlp-webui .
docker run -d -p 3033:3033 -v <your dir>:/downloads yt-dlp-webui

docker run -d -p 3033:3033 \
  -v <your dir>:/downloads \  
  -v <your dir>:/config \ # optional
  yt-dlp-webui

```

If you opt to add RPC authentication...
```sh
docker run -d \
    -p 3033:3033 \
    -e JWT_SECRET randomsecret
    -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
    -v /path/for/config:/config \ # optional
    marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui \
    --auth \
    --user your_username \
    --pass your_pass
```

If you wish for limiting the download queue size...

e.g. limiting max 2 concurrent download.
```sh
docker run -d \
    -p 3033:3033 \
    -e JWT_SECRET randomsecret
    -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
    marcobaobao/yt-dlp-webui \
    --qs 2
```

## [Prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/marcopeocchi/yt-dlp-web-ui/releases) installation

```sh
# download the latest release from the releases page
mv yt-dlp-webui_linux-[your_system_arch] /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp-webui

# /home/user/downloads as an example and yt-dlp in $PATH
yt-dlp-webui --out /home/user/downloads

# specifying yt-dlp path
yt-dlp-webui --out /home/user/downloads --driver /opt/soemdir/yt-dlp

# specifying using a config file

```

### Arguments
```sh

  -auth
        Enable RPC authentication
  -conf string
        Config file path
  -driver string
        yt-dlp executable path (default "yt-dlp")
  -out string
        Where files will be saved (default ".")
  -host string
        Host where server will listen at (default "0.0.0.0")
  -port int
        Port where server will listen at (default 3033)
  -qs int
        Download queue size (default 8)
  -user string
        Username required for auth
  -pass string
        Password required for auth
```

### Config file
By running `yt-dlp-webui` in standalone mode you have the ability to also specify a config file.
The config file **will overwrite what have been passed as cli argument**.

```yaml
# Simple configuration file for yt-dlp webui

---
# Host where server will listen at (default: "0.0.0.0")
#host: 0.0.0.0

# Port where server will listen at (default: 3033)
port: 8989

# Directory where downloaded files will be stored (default: ".")
downloadPath: /home/ren/archive

# [optional] Enable RPC authentication (requires username and password)
require_auth: true
username: my_username
password: my_random_secret

# [optional] The download queue size (default: 8)
queue_size: 4

# [optional] Full path to the yt-dlp (default: "yt-dlp")
downloaderPath: /usr/local/bin/yt-dlp

# [optional] Directory where the log file will be stored (default: ".")
#log_path: .

# [optional] Directory where the session database file will be stored (default: ".")
#session_file_path: .
```

### Systemd integration
By defining a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/yt-dlp-webui.service` yt-dlp webui can be launched as in background.

```
[Unit]
Description=yt-dlp-webui service file
After=network.target

[Service]
User=some_user
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp-webui --out /mnt/share/downloads --port 8100

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```shell
systemctl enable yt-dlp-webui
systemctl start yt-dlp-webui
```
It could be that yt-dlp-webui works correctly when started manually from the console, but with systemd, it does not see the yt-dlp executable, or has issues writing to the database file. One way to fix these issues could be as follows:
```shell
cd
mkdir yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
# optionally move the already existing database file there:
mv local.db yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
nano yt-dlp-webui-workingdir/my.conf
```
The config file format is described above; make sure to include the `downloaderPath` setting (the path can possibly be found by running `which yt-dlp`). For example, one could have:
```
downloadPath: /stuff/media
downloaderPath: /home/your_user/.local/bin/yt-dlp
log_path: /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
session_file_path: /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
```
Adjust the Service section in the `/etc/systemd/system/yt-dlp-webui.service` file as follows:
```
[Service]
User=your_user
Group=your_user
WorkingDirectory=/home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp-webui --conf /home/your_user/yt-dlp-webui-workingdir/my.conf
```

## Manual installation
```sh
# the dependencies are: python3, ffmpeg, nodejs, psmisc, go.

cd frontend
npm i
npm run build

go build -o yt-dlp-webui main.go
```

## Extendable
You dont'like the Material feel?
Want to build your own frontend? We got you covered ü§†

`yt-dlp-webui` now exposes a nice **JSON-RPC 1.0** interface through Websockets and HTTP-POST
It is **planned** to also expose a **gRPC** server.

Just as an overview, these are the available methods:
-   Service.Exec
-   Service.Progress
-   Service.Formats
-   Service.Pending
-   Service.Running
-   Service.Kill
-   Service.KillAll
-   Service.Clear

For more information open an issue on GitHub and I will provide more info ASAP.

## What yt-dlp-webui is not
`yt-dlp-webui` isn't your ordinary website where to download stuff from the internet, so don't try asking for links of where this is hosted. It's a self hosted platform for a Linux NAS.
